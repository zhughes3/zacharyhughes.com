            <h2>this website</h2>
            <p>This site will be used as a document store to remember some of the things I work on. Since I started
                developing software, technical blogs on the internet have helped me overcome countless obstacles, so I
                hope this will serve others like those sites have for me.</p>
            <p>In addition to my development articles, I have three separate endpoints for maintaining data about new
                music I begin to like, new movies or TV shows I watch, and lastly, hobbies I enjoy outside of work. I
                added these to share a little bit more about myself. However, one ancillary benefit I get from this is a
                much more fine-grained understanding of my consumption habits and interests. I hope to do some basic
                data analysis at the end-of-the-year when I have more data at my disposal.</p>
            <p>The frontend styling of this site was adapted from the minimalist work of Josh from
                <a href="https://jrl.ninja" target="_blank">https://jrl.ninja</a>.</p>
